        Eager.io (now Cloudflare Apps) - Web Development Intern <span class="detail">March 2016 - June 2016</span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Eager.io was a platform that allowed developers to create a single 
        <strong>HTML/CSS/JS library</strong> and publish to <strong>WordPress</strong>, <strong>Drupal</strong>, and 
        <strong>Joomla</strong>. My job was to build libraries, test them across browsers, incorporate feedback and 
        deliver high-quality tools. Many apps I built now run on thousands of websites and were built using 
        <strong>Babel</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong>.
