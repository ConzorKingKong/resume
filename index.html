      Eager is an app platform that lets developers create a single <strong>HTML/CSS/JS library</strong> and publish to <strong>WordPress</strong>, <strong>Drupal</strong>, and <strong>Joomla</strong>.

      My job was to build libraries, test them across browsers, incorporate feedback and deliver high-quality tools.

    <p>
       Many apps I built now run on dozens of websites and were built using <strong>Babel</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, and <strong>Sass</strong>.

      I also contributed to the team's <strong>AngularJS</strong> app by adding routes and changing layouts.
